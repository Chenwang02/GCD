# WHAT ARTIST CAN DO WITH ARDUINO
In China, people who study art can only choose liberal Arts in high school, so I haven't had much exposure to arduino or even electronic circuits, but through jazmin's PowerPoint presentation in class, I realised that artists and designers can use arduino to communicate their ideas.


Inspiration
  "no title 1964" which from the poet Augusto de Campos,This artwork is now on display at the Tate Modern., I was attracted by the artist's idea of "typoetry", where letters do not need to have a specific meaning, the shape of the letters themselves constitute the poetry.(https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/campos-no-title-p80683)*

### Reflections
Can I achieve a new century of typoetry with arduino? What can I do for the school and the GCD?
Maybe I could share the ideas of my classmates by lcd and then writing the code for the arduino. The ideas of the students could be recorded and the ideas of all together form a new visual image.
